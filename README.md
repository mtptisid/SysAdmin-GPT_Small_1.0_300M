# SysAdmin-GPT: AI-Powered Linux System Management

## Overview
SysAdmin-GPT is a **custom-built large language model (LLM)** designed for **intelligent system administration**. This project trains an LLM **from scratch**, using vast amounts of system documentation, logs, and technical manuals. It can perform a range of system management tasks, including **automated troubleshooting, system monitoring, log analysis, and command execution**.

## Key Features
- **Custom LLM Training**: Trained from scratch without relying on pre-trained models.
- **Automated System Management**: Execute commands, monitor logs, and optimize Linux performance.
- **Intelligent Troubleshooting**: Analyze system logs and suggest or apply fixes automatically.
- **Fine-tuned for SysAdmin Tasks**: Uses a dataset of Linux commands, system logs, and troubleshooting guides.
- **Multi-Model Interaction**: Supports integration with **LLM-based chat interfaces** for user queries.

## Technology Stack
- **Language Model:** Custom Transformer-based architecture (like GPT)
- **Training Framework:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Dataset:** Custom dataset including Linux documentation, system logs, and command references
- **Tokenizer:** Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or SentencePiece
- **Optimizer:** AdamW for efficient weight updates
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes (for large-scale training & deployment)
- **System Interaction:** SSH, Ansible (for remote management)
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mtptisid/SysAdmin-GPT_Small_1.0_300M.git
cd SysAdmin-GPT_Small_1.0_300M
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare the Dataset
The dataset includes **Linux logs, system documentation, and command executions**. You can create your dataset or use the prepared one.
```bash
python prepare_dataset.py
```

### 4. Train the Model
```bash
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 8
```

### 5. Deploy the Model
```bash
python deploy.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

---

## Usage
### 1. Query the Model
```bash
python interact.py --query "How do I restart Apache on Ubuntu?"
```

### 2. Linux System Management via AI
SysAdmin-GPT can **autonomously manage Linux machines** by running commands through SSH/Ansible.

#### Example: Running a Health Check
```bash
python manage_system.py --task "Check disk usage"
```
#### Example: Restarting a Service
```bash
python manage_system.py --task "Restart Nginx"
```

## Expanding the Project: AI-Driven Linux Automation
To **enhance SysAdmin-GPT**, we are adding:
- **Real-time Log Analysis:** AI monitors system logs and alerts about anomalies.
- **Automated Fixes:** AI suggests and applies system fixes based on best practices.
- **Proactive Optimization:** The model fine-tunes system settings for performance.
- **Voice-Controlled System Management:** Execute commands via voice input.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Fine-tuned model for DevOps tasks** (CI/CD, container orchestration)
- **Multi-server management through AI**
- **Integration with security tools for automated vulnerability scanning**
